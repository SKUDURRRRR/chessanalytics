python comprehensive_test_runner.py --game-analysis # Only game analysis tests
python comprehensive_test_runner.py --arrows        # Only arrow rendering tests
```

### 2. `MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
Comprehensive manual testing checklist for the game analysis page.

**Covers:**
- White/black board orientation testing

### Critical Tests (Manual - Before Deploy)
Use the `MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md` to test:
1. **Game Analysis Page** - Load and navigate games
2. **Board Orientation** - Test with white AND black pieces on bottom
3. **Arrow Rendering** - Verify arrows point correctly in both orientations
4. **Evaluation Bar** - Check updates and orientation
5. **Move Comments** - Verify accuracy and grammar
6. **Exploration Mode** - Test free exploration and follow-up analysis

### Deployment Steps
1. **Build Frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test Backend:**
   ```bash
   python run_MAINTEST.py --quick --ignore-security
   ```

3. **Deploy to Production:**
   - Follow instructions in `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
   - Update environment variables
   - Deploy backend (Railway/Render)
   - Deploy frontend (Vercel)

4. **Post-Deployment Verification:**

## Remaining Tasks Before Production

### High Priority
1. **Manual Testing** - Complete the checklist in `MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
   - Focus on game analysis page with both board orientations
   - Verify arrow rendering in both white/black perspectives
   - Test exploration mode thoroughly

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set production environment variables
   - Verify Supabase production credentials
   - Configure Stockfish path for production server

3. **Database Review**
   - Review any pending migrations in `supabase/migrations/`
   - Verify RLS policies are correctly configured
   - Test with production data (or staging clone)

### Medium Priority
1. **Performance Testing**
   - Load test with multiple concurrent users
   - Test with large game datasets (1000+ games)
   - Verify Stockfish analysis doesn't timeout

2. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Create alerts for critical failures

### Low Priority
1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README if needed
   - Ensure deployment guide is current
   - Add production troubleshooting section
