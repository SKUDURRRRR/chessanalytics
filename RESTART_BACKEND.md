# Backend Restart Instructions

## Quick Fix for Loading Loop Issue

The loading loop fix has been applied, but the backend needs to be restarted for changes to take effect.

## Steps to Restart

### Option 1: Using PowerShell Scripts (Recommended)
```powershell
# Stop the backend
.\stop-all.ps1

# Start the backend
.\start-backend.ps1
```

### Option 2: Manual Restart
1. Stop the Python backend process (Ctrl+C in the terminal running it)
2. Restart it:
```powershell
python python/main.py
```

## Verify the Fix is Working

After restart, check the debug endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/api/v1/debug/progress
```

Or use the debug script:
```bash
python debug_progress.py rajeshsek chess.com
```

Expected output after fix:
- `is_complete` should be `true` when no analysis is running
- `current_phase` should be `"complete"` (not `"fetching"`)

## What Was Fixed

**Before (Broken):**
```json
{
  "is_complete": false,
  "current_phase": "fetching",
  "total_games": 0,
  "analyzed_games": 0
}
```
☝️ This caused infinite loading loops

**After (Fixed):**
```json
{
  "is_complete": true,
  "current_phase": "complete",
  "total_games": 0,
  "analyzed_games": 0
}
```
☝️ This properly indicates no analysis is running

## Testing After Restart

1. **Visit rajeshsek's dashboard** - should load normally (no infinite loading)
2. **Visit skudurrrrr's dashboard** - should work normally
3. **Start analysis** - progress should track correctly
4. **Complete analysis** - should properly refresh and show data

## Rollback (If Needed)

If issues occur, you can rollback by:
```bash
git checkout python/core/unified_api_server.py
git checkout src/pages/SimpleAnalyticsPage.tsx
```
Then restart the backend.
