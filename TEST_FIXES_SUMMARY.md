# Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Unicode Encoding Error in Test Runner
**Problem**: The `run_game_analysis_tests.py` script contained emoji characters that caused `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows terminals.

**Fix**: Replaced all emoji characters with ASCII-friendly alternatives:
- `‚ùå` ‚Üí `[X]`
- `‚úÖ` ‚Üí `[OK]`
- `üé≠` ‚Üí `[*]`
- `‚ö†Ô∏è` ‚Üí `[!]`

**Files Modified**: `run_game_analysis_tests.py`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Test Navigation and Workflow
**Problem**: Tests were looking for incorrect selectors and URL patterns that don't exist in the application.

**Fixes**:
- Updated test to navigate to Match History tab
- Added proper handling for both desktop (table) and mobile (card) layouts
- Fixed URL pattern from `/game-analysis/` to `/analysis/`
- Added viewport-aware element selection

**Files Modified**: `tests/game_analysis_comprehensive.spec.ts`

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Complete Workflow Testing
**Problem**: Tests didn't validate the complete user workflow (import ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí view).

**Fixes Added**:
- `importGames()` helper function to test game import
- `analyzeGame()` helper function to test game analysis
- `navigateToGame()` helper function to navigate to analyzed games
- Updated quick smoke test to run complete workflow

**Test Flow**:
1. Import games for test user
2. Analyze a specific game
3. Navigate to the game analysis page
4. Verify chessboard loads
5. Test move navigation
6. Test board flip
7. Verify evaluation bar

---

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working
- Test runner script executes without encoding errors
- Test navigation logic properly handles responsive layouts
- Complete workflow is defined and structured

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Configuration
- **Test User**: Update `TEST_USER` constant or set `TEST_USER` environment variable to a real chess player
  - Default: `magnuscarlsen` (Lichess)
  - Must be a real player with games available

- **Platform**: Update `TEST_PLATFORM` or set environment variable
  - Options: `lichess` or `chess.com`
  - Default: `lichess`

---

## How to Run Tests

### 1. Set Up Test User
Option A: Use environment variables
```powershell
$env:TEST_USER="your_username"
$env:TEST_PLATFORM="lichess"  # or "chess.com"
```

Option B: Edit `tests/game_analysis_comprehensive.spec.ts`
```typescript
const TEST_USER = 'your_username';
const TEST_PLATFORM = 'lichess'; // or 'chess.com'
```

### 2. Start Servers
Make sure both servers are running:
- **Frontend**: `npm run dev` (port 3000)
- **Backend**: `cd python && python main.py` (port 8002)

### 3. Run Tests
```powershell
# Run all tests
python run_game_analysis_tests.py

# Run quick smoke test only
python run_game_analysis_tests.py --quick

# Run with visible browser
python run_game_analysis_tests.py --headed

# Run specific test group
python run_game_analysis_tests.py --group "Quick Smoke Test"
```

## Test Configuration

See `tests/test-config.example.ts` for example configuration options.

You can customize:
- Test usernames for both Lichess and Chess.com
- Timeout values for different operations
- Default platform

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No games found in match history"
**Cause**: The test user doesn't have games imported yet.

**Solution**:
1. Manually visit the app and import games for the test user
2. OR use a test user that already has games in the database
3. OR increase the import timeout in the test

### "Timeout waiting for Analyzed button"
**Cause**: Game analysis is taking longer than expected.

**Solution**:
1. Check that the backend is running and responding
2. Check backend logs for analysis errors
3. Try analyzing fewer games or increasing timeout

### "Chessboard not loading"
**Cause**: Navigation happened before game was fully analyzed.

**Solution**:
1. Verify the game shows "Analyzed" status before clicking
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify the analysis page URL is correct (`/analysis/...`)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Test Users**: Select real chess players from both Lichess and Chess.com
2. **Import Games**: Ensure test users have games imported in the database
3. **Run Tests**: Execute the test suite and verify all steps pass
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Consider adding these tests to your CI/CD pipeline
