# 🔒 Security Fix Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Credentials
Fixed **6 files** that had hardcoded Supabase credentials:
- ✅ `analyze_score_variance.py`
- ✅ `check_actual_opening_variety.py`
- ✅ `extract_openings_from_pgn.py`
- ✅ `find_opening_data.py`
- ✅ `fix_opening_data.py`
- ✅ `investigate_opening_granularity.py`

All files now use environment variables via `python-dotenv`.

### 2. Added Security Infrastructure
Created comprehensive security protection:

#### Pre-commit Hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- **detect-secrets**: Scans for JWT tokens, API keys, passwords
- **check-added-large-files**: Prevents accidental large file commits
- **detect-private-key**: Catches private key files
- **bandit**: Python security linter

#### Custom Security Scanner (`scripts/check_secrets.py`)
- Scans for hardcoded Supabase credentials
- Detects JWT tokens, API keys, AWS keys
- Runs as part of pre-commit hooks
- Can be run manually anytime

#### Configuration Files
- ✅ `.bandit.yml`: Security scanning configuration
- ✅ `env.example`: Template for required environment variables
- ✅ `SECURITY_POLICY.md`: Complete security guidelines

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Actions You Must Take NOW

### Step 1: Rotate Your Supabase Keys (REQUIRED)

The exposed service role key **MUST** be rotated immediately:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://app.supabase.com
2. **Select your project**: `nhpsnvhvfscrmyniihdn`
3. **Navigate to**: Settings → API
4. **Reset the Service Role Key**:
   - Click the "Reset" button next to Service Role Key
   - Copy the new key
5. **Update your local `.env` file** (see Step 2)
6. **Update any production deployments**:
   - Railway: Update environment variables
   - Vercel: Update environment variables
   - Any other deployments

### Step 2: Create Your `.env` File

Copy the template and add your credentials:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your **NEW** (rotated) credentials:

```bash
# .env
SUPABASE_URL=https://nhpsnvhvfscrmyniihdn.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your_new_service_role_key_here>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your_anon_key_here>
```

**Note**: `.env` is already in `.gitignore` and will not be committed.

### Step 3: Install Pre-commit Hooks

Install the security scanning hooks to prevent this from happening again:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install the hooks
pre-commit install

# Test it works (should pass)
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Step 4: Update Production Deployments

If you have any production deployments (Railway, Vercel, etc.):

1. Go to each deployment platform
2. Update the environment variables with the **NEW** rotated keys
3. Redeploy if necessary

### Step 5: Check Git History (Optional but Recommended)

To see if the exposed credentials were previously committed:

```bash
# Search git history
git log --all --full-history -- "*.py" | grep -i "eyJhbGci"
```

If found in history, the keys are permanently exposed in git history. This is why rotating them is critical.

## 🛡️ How This Prevents Future Issues

### Automatic Prevention

1. **Pre-commit hooks**: Automatically scan every commit for secrets
2. **Custom scanner**: Detects Supabase-specific patterns
3. **Multiple layers**: Uses industry-standard tools (detect-secrets, bandit)

### Manual Checking

Run the security scanner anytime:

```bash
python scripts/check_secrets.py
```

If any credentials are detected, the commit will be **blocked** automatically.

## 📋 Testing Your Setup

### 1. Verify Security Scanner Works

```bash
python scripts/check_secrets.py
```

Expected output: ✅ No security issues detected!

### 2. Test Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

All checks should pass.

### 3. Test Your Scripts Still Work

```bash
# Make sure .env is set up first!
python analyze_score_variance.py
```

Should work normally (no errors about missing environment variables).

## 📖 Security Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Use `.env` files for local development
- ✅ Use platform environment variables for production
- ✅ Rotate credentials every 90 days
- ✅ Run security scans before pushing code
- ✅ Keep `env.example` updated when adding new variables

### DON'T:
- ❌ Hardcode credentials in code
- ❌ Commit `.env` files
- ❌ Share credentials in chat/email
- ❌ Use production keys in development
- ❌ Skip pre-commit hooks

## ✅ Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub, verify:

- [ ] Supabase service role key has been rotated
- [ ] `.env` file created with new credentials
- [ ] `.env` is in `.gitignore` (already done)
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks installed (`pre-commit install`)
- [ ] Security scanner passes (`python scripts/check_secrets.py`)
- [ ] Production deployments updated with new keys
- [ ] All Python scripts tested and working
