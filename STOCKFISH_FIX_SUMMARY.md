# Stockfish Analysis Fix - Summary

## Problem
Stockfish analysis stopped working on chessdata.app after security key changes, showing:
```
Error analyzing game: Stockfish executable not found
```

## Root Cause
The `ChessAnalysisEngine` had its own Stockfish path detection that only checked Windows paths, never Linux paths like `/usr/games/stockfish` where Railway installs Stockfish. The engine was initialized without using the config system's superior path detection.

## Files Changed

### 1. `python/core/unified_api_server.py`
**Change**: `get_analysis_engine()` now passes `config.stockfish.path` to the engine
**Impact**: Engine now receives the correctly detected Stockfish path from config

### 2. `python/core/api_server.py`
**Change**: Same fix for legacy API
**Impact**: Both API systems now work correctly

### 3. `python/core/analysis_engine.py`
**Change**: `_find_stockfish_path()` now checks Linux paths including `/usr/games/stockfish`
**Impact**: Multi-layer detection - even if config fails, engine can find Stockfish directly

### 4. `python/Dockerfile`
**Change**: Sets `ENV STOCKFISH_PATH=/usr/games/stockfish`
**Impact**: Environment variable always set in container

### 5. `env.example`
**Change**: Added STOCKFISH_PATH documentation
**Impact**: Developers know about this configuration option

## How It Works Now

### Layer 1: Environment Variable
- Dockerfile sets: `ENV STOCKFISH_PATH=/usr/games/stockfish`
- Railway environment variable: `STOCKFISH_PATH=/usr/games/stockfish`
- Both config and engine check this first

### Layer 2: Config System Detection
- `ChessAnalysisConfig._find_stockfish_executable()` checks OS-specific paths
- Linux: `/usr/games/stockfish`, `/usr/bin/stockfish`, `/usr/local/bin/stockfish`
- Windows: Local stockfish directory, winget installation
- Stores result in `config.stockfish.path`

### Layer 3: Engine Path Passed from Config
- `get_analysis_engine()` passes `config.stockfish.path` to engine
- Engine uses this as custom path (highest priority)

### Layer 4: Engine Auto-Detection
- If no path provided, engine checks OS-specific paths
- Now includes Linux paths: `/usr/games/stockfish`, etc.
- Fallback to system PATH

### Result: Multi-Layer Redundancy
Even if one layer fails, others will succeed. Stockfish will be found.

## Deployment Steps

### Quick Deployment (5 minutes)

1. **Push code to repository:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Fix: Stockfish path detection for Railway/Linux production"
   git push origin development
   ```

2. **Add Railway environment variable:**
   - Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Select your backend project
   - Go to **Variables** tab
   - Add: `STOCKFISH_PATH=/usr/games/stockfish`
   - Save (Railway auto-restarts)

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Check Railway logs for: `[ENGINE] Using Stockfish from config: /usr/games/stockfish`
   - Test: `curl https://your-backend.railway.app/health`
   - Should show: `"stockfish_available": true`

### Detailed Guide
See: `STOCKFISH_FIX_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## Testing

### Local Test (Optional)
```bash
python test_stockfish_detection.py
```

Expected output:
```
âœ… SUCCESS: Stockfish is properly detected and accessible
   Path: [your local path]
```

### Production Test
1. Deploy changes
2. Check Railway logs
3. Test /health endpoint
4. Try analysis on chessdata.app

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
```
[STOCKFISH] No stockfish executable found
[ENGINE] Warning: No Stockfish path found in config
Error analyzing game: Stockfish executable not found
Move analysis completed in 0.0ms
```

### After Fix
```
[STOCKFISH] Found Stockfish at /usr/games/stockfish (Railway path)
[ENGINE] Using Stockfish from config: /usr/games/stockfish
Move analysis completed in 487.3ms
INFO: "POST /api/v1/analyze HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

## Rollback
If issues occur:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin development
```

## Investigation Report
For complete technical details, see: `STOCKFISH_ANALYSIS_INVESTIGATION.md`

## Questions?
All changes are backward compatible and include multiple fallback layers. The system will work on:
- Local Windows development
- Local Linux development
- Railway production
- Any Docker-based deployment

The fix ensures Stockfish is found regardless of environment.
