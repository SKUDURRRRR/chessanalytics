## ðŸ”§ Final Steps

### Step 1: Verify Migration on Correct Database

Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nhpsnvhvfscrmyniihdn/sql

Run this to verify the column exists:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'games' AND column_name = 'opening_normalized';
```

**Expected result:** One row showing the column exists

**If no results**, run this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS opening_normalized TEXT DEFAULT 'Unknown';

UPDATE games 
SET opening_normalized = COALESCE(
  NULLIF(TRIM(opening_family), ''),
  NULLIF(TRIM(opening), ''),
  'Unknown'
)
WHERE opening_normalized IS NULL OR opening_normalized = '';

NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
```

### Step 2: Restart Backend

In your terminal:
```powershell
# Stop backend (Ctrl+C)
# Then start it
cd "c:/my files/Projects/chess-analytics"
python python/main.py
```

### Step 3: Hard Refresh Browser

Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` to clear cache

### Step 4: Try Import

Click "Import Games (100)"

## ðŸŽ¯ What Should Happen Now

**Backend logs should show:**
```
[import_games] Upserting 100 game rows
[import_games] Verifying games were actually inserted...
[import_games] games upsert succeeded and verified: 100 rows affected, 3 verified in DB
[import_games] Upserting 100 PGN rows
[import_games] pgn upsert successful, 100 rows affected
[Smart import] Success: imported_games=100
```

**Frontend should show:**
```
Import complete! Imported 100 new games. Refreshing analytics...
```

**Dashboard should display:**
- Total Games: 100 (or your count)
- Stats populate correctly
- No errors in console

## ðŸš¨ If Still Failing

Share:
1. Backend log output
2. Browser console errors
3. Result of the SQL verification query
