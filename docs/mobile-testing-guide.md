2. Navigate to analytics page
3. Open Mobile Testing Panel
4. Run automated tests
5. Review generated report

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Touch target validation
- [ ] Horizontal scroll detection
- [ ] Breakpoint testing
- [ ] Performance measurement
- [ ] Accessibility checks

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Touch Target Issues
**Problem:** Buttons too small for touch
**Solution:** Ensure minimum 44px touch targets

### Horizontal Scroll
**Problem:** Content overflows viewport
**Solution:** Use responsive containers and overflow handling

### Performance Issues
**Problem:** Slow loading on mobile
**Solution:** Optimize images, lazy load content, reduce bundle size

### Navigation Problems
**Problem:** Mobile navigation not working
**Solution:** Check z-index, positioning, and touch event handling
