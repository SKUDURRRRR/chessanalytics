# Import Issues - Fix Implementation Summary

## Problem
1. **"Import More Games" button getting stuck** - Shows "Starting import of up to 5,000 games..." at 0/5000 and never progresses
2. **Auto-sync not running on page refresh** - Only ran once per session, preventing new game detection on refresh

## Root Causes Identified
1. Poor error logging made it impossible to diagnose backend failures
2. Chess.com API failures were failing silently
3. Database query errors were not being caught or reported
4. Frontend had an overly aggressive session guard preventing auto-sync reruns
5. No timeout detection for stuck imports

## Fixes Implemented

### Backend Fixes (`python/core/unified_api_server.py`)

#### 1. Enhanced Error Logging in `_perform_large_import` (lines 2793-2840)
- Added detailed startup logging with canonical user ID and key
- Added try-catch around database query for existing games
- Added error messages to progress state on failures
- Added batch-level logging showing fetch progress

#### 2. Comprehensive Batch Fetch Error Handling (lines 2856-2876)
- Added try-catch around `_fetch_games_from_platform` calls
- Log detailed batch information (batch number, offset, pagination state)
- Update progress state with specific error messages on fetch failures
- Prevent silent failures from stopping the import

#### 3. Detailed Chess.com API Logging in `_fetch_chesscom_games` (lines 2039-2139)
- Log function entry with all parameters
- Log each month being fetched with URL and response status
- Log number of games found per month and parsing progress
- Handle and log individual month fetch errors without killing entire import
- Log completion with total games and months checked
- Added full traceback on exceptions

#### 4. Import Batch Error Handling (lines 2948-2989)
- Added try-catch around the `import_games` call
- Log import attempt and success/failure
- Update progress state with specific error messages
- Prevent one bad batch from stopping entire import

### Frontend Fixes (`src/pages/SimpleAnalyticsPage.tsx`)

#### 1. Removed Auto-Sync Session Guard (lines 335-365)
- Removed `autoSyncRunRef` session tracking that prevented reruns
- Changed to simple `autoSyncing` state check to prevent duplicate simultaneous runs
- Now allows auto-sync to run on every page refresh (like Lichess users)

#### 2. Added Import Timeout Detection (lines 95-96, 297-362)
- Added `lastImportProgressRef` to track progress changes
- Added `importStuckTimeoutRef` for timeout management
- Implemented 30-second timeout detection in `startLargeImportPolling`
- Automatically shows error message if no progress for 30 seconds
- Resets timeout when progress is detected
- Cleans up timeouts when import completes

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Manual Import
1. Restart the backend server to see all the new logs
2. Click "Import More Games" button
3. Watch the backend console for detailed logs:
   - Should see "===== STARTING LARGE IMPORT ====="
   - Should see database query results
   - Should see "===== BATCH N =====" for each batch
   - Should see Chess.com API responses
   - Should see games being parsed and imported
4. Frontend should show progress updates every 2 seconds
5. If stuck for 30 seconds, should show timeout error

### 2. Test Auto-Sync on Refresh
1. Import some games for a user
2. Play a new game on Chess.com
3. Refresh the browser page
4. Should see auto-sync notification with new game count
5. Refresh again - should check for new games again (not skip)

### 3. Check Backend Logs
The enhanced logging will show exactly where any issues occur:
- Database connection issues
- Chess.com API failures
- Game parsing errors
- Import batch errors

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Manual Import ("Import More Games")
- ✅ Shows detailed progress in backend logs
- ✅ Updates progress bar every 2 seconds
- ✅ Shows specific error messages if anything fails
- ✅ Detects and reports stuck imports after 30 seconds
- ✅ Completes successfully if everything works

### Auto-Sync (Page Refresh)
- ✅ Runs on every page refresh for existing users
- ✅ Checks for new games since last import
- ✅ Shows notification with new game count
- ✅ Prevents duplicate simultaneous runs
- ✅ Auto-dismisses after showing results

## Files Modified
1. `python/core/unified_api_server.py` - Enhanced error logging throughout import flow
2. `src/pages/SimpleAnalyticsPage.tsx` - Removed session guard, added timeout detection

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Restart the backend server
2. Try importing games and watch backend console for detailed logs
3. If import still fails, the logs will now show exactly why
4. Test page refresh to ensure auto-sync runs every time
5. Let the import sit for 30+ seconds to test timeout detection
