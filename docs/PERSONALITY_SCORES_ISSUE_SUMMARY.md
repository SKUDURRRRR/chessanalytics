# Summary: Personality Scores Not Updating After Analysis

## Problem

After importing and analyzing 5 games for player maine49, the following blocks were not updating with the analyzed game data:

1. **Chess Personality Radar** - All traits showing default score of 50 (neutral)
2. **Game Style Section** - Showing "0 games" despite having analyzed games
3. **Opening Analysis** - Showing contradictory data (0% win rate but mentioning specific openings with 100% win rate)

## Root Cause

**Stale Backend Cache**

The backend deep analysis endpoint (`/api/v1/deep-analysis/{user_id}/{platform}`) caches personality scores and game statistics for 5 minutes. When games are analyzed:

1. New analysis data is written to the `game_analyses` table ✅
2. Frontend cache is cleared ✅
3. **Backend cache was NOT being cleared** ❌

Result: The next data fetch returned stale cached data with:
- Default personality scores (all 50s)
- Old game counts (0 games)
- Missing analyzed game data

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes (`python/core/unified_api_server.py`)

1. **Added cache deletion function**:
```python
def _delete_from_cache(cache_key: str) -> None:
    """Delete a specific cache entry."""
```

2. **Added cache clearing endpoint**:
```python
@app.delete("/api/v1/clear-cache/{user_id}/{platform}")
async def clear_user_cache(user_id, platform):
    """Clear all cached data for a specific user and platform."""
    # Clears: deep_analysis, stats, comprehensive_analytics
```

3. **Added force_refresh parameter to deep analysis**:
```python
@app.get("/api/v1/deep-analysis/{user_id}/{platform}")
async def get_deep_analysis(user_id, platform, force_refresh: bool = False):
    # Now supports bypassing cache
```

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated UnifiedAnalysisService** (`src/services/unifiedAnalysisService.ts`):
   - Added `clearBackendCache()` method
   - Updated `getDeepAnalysis()` to support force_refresh parameter

2. **Updated apiCache** (`src/utils/apiCache.ts`):
   - Modified `clearUserCache()` to also clear backend cache via API

## How to Fix maine49 Data

Since maine49 already has analyzed games but the old cached data is still being served, you need to manually clear the cache **once**:

### Option 1: API Call (Recommended)
```powershell
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/clear-cache/maine49/lichess"
```

### Option 2: Restart Backend
```powershell
# Stop backend (Ctrl+C in the terminal running START_BACKEND_LOCAL.ps1)
# Restart backend
.\START_BACKEND_LOCAL.ps1
```

### Option 3: Wait 5 Minutes
The cache TTL is 5 minutes, so waiting will eventually clear it (but manual clearing is faster).

After clearing cache, refresh the analytics page and you should see:
- ✅ Personality radar with calculated scores (not all 50s)
- ✅ Game style section showing correct game count
- ✅ Opening analysis with consistent data

## Future Behavior

With this fix in place, **all future analysis runs will automatically clear the cache**, so you won't need to manually clear it again. The workflow is now:

1. User clicks "Analyze My Games"
2. Analysis runs and completes
3. Frontend calls `clearUserCache(userId, platform)`
4. Frontend cache is cleared (existing behavior)
5. **Backend cache is cleared** (new behavior via DELETE endpoint)
6. Next page refresh fetches fresh data with updated personality scores

## Verification

After clearing the cache, verify the fix worked by checking:

1. **Personality Radar** - Should show varied scores (e.g., Tactical: 65, Aggressive: 72, Patient: 48)
2. **Game Style** - Should show correct game count (e.g., "You are an advanced player across 5 games")
3. **Opening Analysis** - Should show consistent win rates
4. **Backend Logs** - Should show cache clearing messages:
   ```
   [INFO] Clearing cache for user_id=maine49, platform=lichess
   [CACHE] Deleted key: deep_analysis:maine49:lichess
   ```

## Documentation

I've created two documentation files:

1. **`docs/PERSONALITY_SCORES_CACHE_FIX.md`** - Technical explanation of the fix
2. **`docs/TESTING_PERSONALITY_SCORES_FIX.md`** - Detailed testing instructions and troubleshooting

## Files Modified

- `python/core/unified_api_server.py` - Added cache clearing endpoint and force_refresh support
- `src/services/unifiedAnalysisService.ts` - Added clearBackendCache method
- `src/utils/apiCache.ts` - Updated to clear both frontend and backend caches
- `docs/PERSONALITY_SCORES_CACHE_FIX.md` - Technical documentation (NEW)
- `docs/TESTING_PERSONALITY_SCORES_FIX.md` - Testing guide (NEW)

All changes have been tested for TypeScript lint errors and Python syntax - no errors found.
