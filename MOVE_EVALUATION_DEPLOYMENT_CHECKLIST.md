- [x] ✅ Created fix summary (`MOVE_EVALUATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md`)
- [x] ✅ Created deployment checklist (this file)
- [x] ✅ Created test script (`test_move_evaluation_fix.py`)

### Testing

- [ ] ⏳ Run test script: `python test_move_evaluation_fix.py`
- [ ] ⏳ Test backend with sample games
- [ ] ⏳ Verify no errors in backend logs
- [ ] ⏳ Test frontend displays new categories correctly
- [ ] ⏳ Verify move badges show correct colors

---

## Deployment Steps

### Backend Deployment

1. **Backup Current System**
   ```bash
   # Backup database
   cd scripts
   python backup_database.py
   
   # Backup code
   python backup_code.py
   ```

2. **Deploy Backend Changes**
   ```bash
   # Stop backend
   ./stop-all.ps1
   
   # Pull changes or verify local changes
   git status
   
   # Start backend
   ./start-all.ps1
   ```

3. **Verify Backend**
   ```bash
   # Check logs for errors
   tail -f python/backend.out.log
   
   # Test API endpoint
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

### Frontend Deployment

1. **Build Frontend**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Verify Build**
   - Check for TypeScript errors
   - Verify bundle size is reasonable
   - Test in development mode first

3. **Deploy Frontend**
   - Deploy to hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
   - Or serve from `dist/` directory

### Database Updates

**Note:** No database schema changes required! The new fields (`is_great`, `is_excellent`) are optional and will default to `false` for existing records.

However, to get accurate classifications for existing games:

1. **Option 1: Re-analyze All Games** (Recommended for production)
   ```bash
   cd python
   python scripts/reanalyze_sample_games.py
   ```

2. **Option 2: Gradual Re-analysis**
   - Users can manually re-analyze their games
   - New analyses will use the updated logic
   - Old analyses remain unchanged

3. **Option 3: No Action**
   - Keep existing analyses as-is
   - Only new analyses will use updated logic

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks (0-1 hours)

- [ ] ⏳ Backend starts without errors
- [ ] ⏳ Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] ⏳ API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] ⏳ No JavaScript console errors
- [ ] ⏳ Move classifications display correctly
- [ ] ⏳ New badges (Great, Excellent) show proper colors

### Short-Term Monitoring (1-7 days)

- [ ] ⏳ Monitor error logs for undefined variable errors
- [ ] ⏳ Check brilliant move frequency (should be 0-2 per game)
- [ ] ⏳ Verify Nxe5 and similar captures are NOT brilliant
- [ ] ⏳ Collect user feedback on new classifications
- [ ] ⏳ Monitor database performance

### Long-Term Validation (1-4 weeks)

- [ ] ⏳ Compare accuracy scores with Chess.com (if available)
- [ ] ⏳ Analyze brilliant move distribution across games
- [ ] ⏳ Survey users about classification accuracy
- [ ] ⏳ Fine-tune thresholds based on feedback

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are found:

### Quick Rollback

1. **Restore Backend**
   ```bash
   # Stop current backend
   ./stop-all.ps1
   
   # Revert code changes
   git revert HEAD
   
   # Restart backend
   ./start-all.ps1
   ```

2. **Restore Frontend**
   ```bash
   # Redeploy previous version
   git revert HEAD
   npm run build
   # Deploy to hosting
   ```

### Database Rollback

**Not required** - No schema changes were made. Old data continues to work.

---

## Expected Results After Deployment

### Move Classifications

✅ **Nxe5** (simple capture): "Best" or "Good"  
✅ **Kxf7** (king capture): "Mistake" or "Blunder"  
✅ **Queen sac for mate**: "Brilliant"  
✅ **Standard opening moves**: "Best", "Great", or "Excellent"  

### Brilliant Move Frequency

✅ **Before:** 5-10+ per game (incorrect)  
✅ **After:** 0-2 per game (correct)  

### Move Distribution

For an intermediate player (1400-1800 rating):

- Best: ~10-20%
- Great: ~20-30%
- Excellent: ~10-15%
- Good: ~10-15%
- Acceptable: ~10-20%
- Inaccuracy: ~5-10%
- Mistake: ~2-5%
- Blunder: ~1-3%
- Brilliant: ~0-1% (very rare)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Resolved

✅ Undefined `optimal_cp` variable - **FIXED**  
✅ False brilliant move labels - **FIXED**  
✅ Missing move categories - **FIXED**  
✅ Inconsistent thresholds - **FIXED**  

### Outstanding

⚠️ **Quiet Brilliant Moves**: Not yet detected (only sacrifices and mates)  
⚠️ **Position Complexity**: Not yet considered  
⚠️ **Player Rating Context**: Not yet implemented  
⚠️ **Old Data**: Requires re-analysis for updated classifications
