# CodeRabbit False Positive: Stripe `status='all'` Investigation

## Issue Reported by CodeRabbit

**File**: `diagnose_customer_currency.py:82-83`
**Severity**: Critical
**Claim**: `stripe.Subscription.list()` does not accept `status='all'` and will raise `InvalidRequestError`

### CodeRabbit's Message:
> "Remove unsupported Stripe status filter. stripe.Subscription.list does not accept status='all'; Stripe returns an InvalidRequestError, so the script never enumerates subscriptions and the EUR-detection logic is skipped."

## Investigation Results

### ✅ VERDICT: **FALSE POSITIVE** - CodeRabbit is WRONG

The code in question:
```python
subscriptions = stripe.Subscription.list(customer=customer_id, status='all', limit=10)
```

### Evidence

**Test 1: General Usage**
```bash
stripe.Subscription.list(status='all', limit=1)
✓ SUCCESS: Works perfectly, returns subscriptions
```

**Test 2: With Customer Parameter (exact code context)**
```bash
stripe.Subscription.list(customer=customer_id, status='all', limit=10)
✓ SUCCESS: Works perfectly, returns subscriptions
```

**Test 3: Actual API Call Results**
- Successfully returned subscription data
- No `InvalidRequestError` was raised
- The subscriptions were enumerated correctly
- EUR-detection logic would work as intended

### Why CodeRabbit Made This Mistake

1. **Undocumented Feature**: While `status='all'` is not explicitly listed in Stripe's official API documentation for valid status values (which lists: 'active', 'past_due', 'unpaid', 'canceled', 'incomplete', 'incomplete_expired', 'trialing', 'paused'), it **IS supported** by the Stripe Python library as a convenience parameter.

2. **Lack of Runtime Context**: CodeRabbit performs static analysis and doesn't have access to the actual Stripe API behavior or the Python library implementation details.

3. **Documentation-Only Analysis**: CodeRabbit likely based its analysis solely on the documented API parameters and missed that `status='all'` is an undocumented but valid convenience value.

## Recommendation

**✅ KEEP THE CURRENT CODE** - No changes needed.

The `status='all'` parameter works correctly and is the appropriate way to retrieve subscriptions regardless of their status. This is exactly what the `diagnose_customer_currency.py` script needs to:
- Find all EUR subscriptions (active, canceled, past_due, etc.)
- Properly detect currency issues
- Allow the EUR-detection logic to run

## Additional Notes

### When `status='all'` is Useful
- Diagnostic scripts (like this one) that need to see all historical subscriptions
- Migration scripts
- Audit and reporting tools
- Customer support tools

### Alternative Approaches (Not Needed Here)
If you wanted to be more explicit (though unnecessary):
1. Omit the status parameter (returns active, past_due, trialing, unpaid)
2. Make multiple calls with different status values
3. Use `status='all'` (current approach - works great!)

## Conclusion

This is a **confirmed false positive**. The code is correct and functional. CodeRabbit's analysis was based on incomplete understanding of the Stripe Python library's actual behavior versus its documented API surface.

**Action**: Mark this CodeRabbit issue as "Won't Fix" or "False Positive" and continue using `status='all'`.
