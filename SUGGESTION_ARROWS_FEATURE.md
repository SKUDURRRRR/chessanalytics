# Suggestion Arrows and Follow-Up Button Enhancement

## Overview
This enhancement adds suggestion arrows and a follow-up button for all non-best moves, providing users with visual guidance on better alternatives.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Arrow Generation Logic
**File:** `src/utils/chessArrows.ts`

**Previous Behavior:**
- Best move suggestion arrows only appeared for `inaccuracy`, `mistake`, and `blunder` classifications

**New Behavior:**
- Best move suggestion arrows now appear for ANY move that is NOT `best` or `brilliant`
- This includes: `great`, `excellent`, `good`, `acceptable`, `inaccuracy`, `mistake`, `blunder`, `uncategorized`

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// OLD: Only show for mistakes
const shouldShowBestMove =
  moveAnalysis.bestMoveSan &&
  moveAnalysis.bestMoveSan !== moveAnalysis.san &&
  ['inaccuracy', 'mistake', 'blunder'].includes(moveAnalysis.classification)

// NEW: Show for any non-best move
const shouldShowBestMove =
  moveAnalysis.bestMoveSan &&
  moveAnalysis.bestMoveSan !== moveAnalysis.san &&
  !['best', 'brilliant'].includes(moveAnalysis.classification)
```

### 2. Updated Follow-Up Explorer Visibility
**File:** `src/components/chess/FollowUpExplorer.tsx`

**Previous Behavior:**
- "Show Follow-Up" button only appeared for critical moves (`inaccuracy`, `mistake`, `blunder`)

**New Behavior:**
- "Show Follow-Up" button now appears for ANY move that is NOT `best` or `brilliant`
- Users can explore better variations for moves classified as `great`, `excellent`, `good`, etc.

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// OLD: Only show for critical moves
const hasBetterMove = useMemo(() => {
  return currentMove.bestMoveSan &&
         currentMove.bestMoveSan !== currentMove.san &&
         ['inaccuracy', 'mistake', 'blunder'].includes(currentMove.classification)
}, [currentMove])

// NEW: Show for any non-best move
const hasBetterMove = useMemo(() => {
  return currentMove.bestMoveSan &&
         currentMove.bestMoveSan !== currentMove.san &&
         !['best', 'brilliant'].includes(currentMove.classification)
}, [currentMove])
```

## User Experience Impact

### Visual Feedback
When a user makes a move that is not the best:
1. **Green Arrow** - Shows the best move alternative on the board
2. **Yellow/Red Arrow** - Shows the move they actually played (color based on move quality)
3. **Follow-Up Button** - Allows exploration of what would happen after the best move

### Educational Value
- Users can immediately see better alternatives for moves like "Good" (not just mistakes)
- Helps users understand the difference between "good" and "best" moves
- Encourages learning even when moves are acceptable but not optimal

### Example Scenario
**Before:** User plays Qh5 (rated as "Good")
- No suggestion arrow shown
- No follow-up exploration available

**After:** User plays Qh5 (rated as "Good")
- Green arrow shows best move alternative (e.g., Qe7)
- "Show Follow-Up" button appears
- User can click to explore the better variation

## Technical Notes

- Changes are backward compatible
- No API changes required
- All existing move classifications continue to work as expected
- Performance impact is minimal (same arrow generation logic, just expanded conditions)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various move classifications:
   - Brilliant ✓ (no arrows - move is optimal)
   - Best ✓ (no arrows - move is optimal)
   - Great → (arrows + button shown)
   - Excellent → (arrows + button shown)
   - Good → (arrows + button shown)
   - Acceptable → (arrows + button shown)
   - Inaccuracy → (arrows + button shown)
   - Mistake → (arrows + button shown)
   - Blunder → (arrows + button shown)

2. Verify arrow colors:
   - Best move suggestion: Green (#10b981)
   - Actual move: Color based on classification

3. Test follow-up exploration:
   - Click "Show Follow-Up" button
   - Verify best move variation is displayed
   - Check that position updates correctly

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
1. Add tooltip on hover over suggestion arrow explaining why it's better
2. Show centipawn difference between played move and best move
3. Add animation when arrow appears
4. Allow users to toggle this feature on/off in settings
5. Show multiple move suggestions (2nd best, 3rd best) for advanced users
