# Capacity Investigation Summary

## Overview

I've completed a comprehensive investigation of your Chess Analytics application's capacity to handle multiple concurrent users performing various activities (importing games, analyzing them, browsing analytics).

---

## Key Findings

### Current Architecture Strengths ✅

Your application is **well-architected** with modern optimizations:

1. **Async FastAPI backend** - efficient concurrent request handling
2. **Stockfish engine pooling** - reuses engines (3-4 max), TTL-based cleanup
3. **Queue-based job processing** - prevents resource exhaustion
4. **Memory optimizations** - reduced from 1.4 GB to ~400 MB baseline
5. **HTTP connection pooling** - efficient external API calls
6. **LRU caching** - 5-minute TTL for analytics and evaluations
7. **Configurable concurrency** - adapts to deployment tier

### Current Capacity Estimates

| User Count | Status | Performance | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **10-20 users** | ✅ Comfortable | <2s response, no queuing | Current sweet spot |
| **20-30 users** | ⚠️ Acceptable | 2-5s response, some queuing | With Phase 1 optimizations |
| **30-50 users** | ⚠️ Degraded | 5-15s response, heavy queuing | Requires infrastructure upgrade |
| **50-100 users** | ❌ Poor | Timeouts, severe delays | Needs Phase 2 upgrade ($60-80/mo) |
| **100+ users** | ❌ System collapse | Unusable | Needs horizontal scaling ($150+/mo) |

## Bottlenecks Identified

### Primary Bottlenecks (Current Railway Pro - 8GB)

1. **Stockfish Engine Pool** - Limited to 3-4 engines
   - Impacts: >15 concurrent analysis operations
   - Solution: Increase pool size or scale horizontally

2. **Analysis Concurrency** - 4 jobs max
   - Impacts: >20 users doing analysis
   - Solution: Increase to 5-6 jobs (free)

3. **Import Concurrency** - 2 imports max
   - Impacts: >10 concurrent imports
   - Solution: Increase to 3-4 imports (watch memory)

4. **CPU Saturation** - 8 vCPUs
   - Impacts: >40 concurrent users
   - Solution: Upgrade infrastructure

5. **HTTP Connections** - 15 total
   - Impacts: Heavy import activity
   - Solution: Increase connection limit

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Monitor Current Usage**
   - Track actual user counts and activity patterns
   - Identify peak usage times
   - Measure actual response times

2. **Implement Phase 1 Optimizations** (if needed)
   - Only if you're seeing >15 concurrent users
   - Zero cost, 1-2 days effort
   - Extends comfortable capacity to 25-30 users

3. **Set Up Monitoring Alerts**
   - Memory >70% for 5+ minutes
   - Queue depth >5 jobs
   - Response time p95 >5s

### Planning for Growth

**If expecting 10-30 users in next 3 months:**
- Current infrastructure is fine
- Implement Phase 1 optimizations when needed
- Cost: $20-30/month (current)

**If expecting 30-75 users in next 3 months:**

## Monitoring Dashboard (Recommended)

### Essential Metrics to Track

1. **Concurrent Users** - active sessions
2. **Request Rate** - requests/second by endpoint
3. **Queue Depth** - analysis and import queues
4. **Response Time** - p50, p95, p99 latency
5. **Error Rate** - 5xx errors, timeouts
6. **Resource Usage** - memory, CPU, engine pool
7. **Cache Hit Rate** - should be >60%
8. **Database Performance** - query times

### Alerts to Set Up

- Memory >70% for 5+ minutes → Email
- CPU >90% for 5+ minutes → Email
- Queue depth >10 jobs → Slack
- Error rate >5% → Pager
- Response time p95 >5s → Slack

## Questions Answered

### Q: How many users can we handle right now?
**A:** Comfortably 10-20 concurrent users. Acceptable performance up to 30-40 users with some queuing delays.

### Q: What happens at higher load?
**A:** At 50+ users, you'll see significant queuing (1-5 min waits), timeout errors, and poor user experience. System would be overloaded.

### Q: How much will it cost to scale to 100 users?
**A:** Phase 2 upgrade (~$60-80/month) gets you to 75 users. For 100 users, you'd need Phase 3 (~$150-250/month) with horizontal scaling.

### Q: What's the biggest bottleneck?
**A:** Stockfish engine pool (3-4 engines) is the primary bottleneck for analysis-heavy workloads. CPU becomes the bottleneck at 40+ users.

### Q: Can we scale horizontally now?
**A:** Not without significant architectural changes (load balancer, shared Redis queue, multiple API instances). Phase 3 addresses this.

### Q: What's the fastest way to increase capacity?
**A:** Phase 1 optimizations (increase concurrency limits) can give you +50% capacity in 1-2 days with zero cost.
