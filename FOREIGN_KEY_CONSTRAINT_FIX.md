# Foreign Key Constraint Fix

## Problem

After game analysis completed, the system was encountering a database foreign key constraint violation:

```
[PERSISTENCE] ❌ FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT VIOLATION: 
insert or update on table "game_analyses" violates foreign key constraint "fk_game_analyses_game"
Key (user_id, platform, game_id)=(skudurrrrr, chess.com, Chess.com) is not present in table "games"
```

The issue was that `game_id` was being set to `"Chess.com"` instead of the actual game ID.

## Root Cause

When analyzing a game with PGN data, if no `game_id` was explicitly provided:

1. The `analyze_game` method in `analysis_engine.py` tried to extract the game_id from the PGN's `Site` header
2. The extraction logic was: `headers.get('Site', '').split('/')[-1]`
3. If the Site header was just `"https://www.chess.com"` or `"https://www.chess.com/"`, splitting by `/` and taking the last part would give `"Chess.com"` or an empty string
4. This invalid game_id was then used when trying to save the analysis to the database, causing the foreign key constraint violation

Additionally, the `_handle_single_game_analysis` function in `unified_api_server.py` wasn't passing the `game_id` parameter to `analyze_game`, even when it was available in the request.

## Solution

### 1. Improved game_id Extraction Logic (`analysis_engine.py`)

Enhanced the game_id extraction to properly parse URLs and skip platform names:

```python
# Extract game ID from Site URL (e.g., "https://www.chess.com/game/live/123456" -> "123456")
if site:
    parts = site.split('/')
    # Get the last non-empty part, skipping platform names and common URL parts
    game_id = next((part for part in reversed(parts) 
                    if part and part not in ['chess.com', 'lichess.org', 
                                             'www.chess.com', 'www.lichess.org', 
                                             'game', 'live']), None)

# If we couldn't extract from Site, try Link header
if not game_id:
    link = headers.get('Link', '')
    if link:
        parts = link.split('/')
        game_id = next((part for part in reversed(parts) 
                       if part and part not in ['chess.com', 'lichess.org', 
                                                'www.chess.com', 'www.lichess.org', 
                                                'game', 'live']), None)

# Last resort: generate a unique game ID
if not game_id:
    game_id = f"game_{int(datetime.now().timestamp() * 1000)}"
```

### 2. Pass game_id to analyze_game (`unified_api_server.py`)

Modified `_handle_single_game_analysis` to pass the game_id when available:

```python
# Analyze game - pass game_id if provided in request
game_id = request.game_id or request.provider_game_id
game_analysis = await engine.analyze_game(
    request.pgn, 
    request.user_id, 
    request.platform, 
    analysis_type_enum,
    game_id
)
```

### 3. Pre-validation in Persistence Layer (`reliable_analysis_persistence.py`)

Added validation to check if the game exists in the `games` table before attempting to save the analysis:

```python
# First verify that the game exists in the games table
try:
    game_check = self.supabase_service.table('games').select('id').eq(
        'user_id', analysis_data['user_id']
    ).eq('platform', analysis_data['platform']).eq(
        'provider_game_id', analysis_data['game_id']
    ).limit(1).execute()
    
    if not game_check.data:
        print(f"[PERSISTENCE] ❌ Game not found in games table:")
        print(f"[PERSISTENCE]    user_id: {analysis_data['user_id']}")
        print(f"[PERSISTENCE]    platform: {analysis_data['platform']}")
        print(f"[PERSISTENCE]    game_id: {analysis_data['game_id']}")
        print(f"[PERSISTENCE] This game must be imported first before analysis can be saved.")
        return False, None
except Exception as check_error:
    print(f"[PERSISTENCE] ⚠️  Warning: Could not verify game existence: {check_error}")
    # Continue anyway - let the database constraint catch it
```

## Files Modified

1. **python/core/analysis_engine.py**
   - Lines 737-756: Improved game_id extraction logic to properly parse URLs and skip platform names

2. **python/core/unified_api_server.py**
   - Lines 2706-2713: Pass game_id parameter to analyze_game when available

3. **python/core/reliable_analysis_persistence.py**
   - Lines 166-183: Added game existence validation in `_save_to_both_tables`
   - Lines 344-361: Added game existence validation in `_save_to_game_analyses`

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Test with valid game_id in request**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/v1/analyze \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "user_id": "skudurrrrr",
       "platform": "chess.com",
       "pgn": "<PGN data>",
       "game_id": "actual_game_id",
       "analysis_type": "deep"
     }'
   ```

2. **Test with PGN containing proper Site header**:
   - Ensure PGN has Site header like: `[Site "https://www.chess.com/game/live/123456"]`
   - System should extract `"123456"` as the game_id

3. **Test with PGN containing only platform URL**:
   - If PGN has Site header like: `[Site "https://www.chess.com"]`
   - System should generate a unique game_id: `f"game_{timestamp}"`

4. **Monitor logs** for proper game_id extraction:
   ```
   [GAME ANALYSIS] Parsing PGN for game_id: <actual_id>, user: <user>, platform: <platform>
   [PERSISTENCE] Saving to game_analyses table: user=<user>, game=<actual_id>, type=<type>
   ```

## Expected Behavior

After this fix:
- ✅ Game IDs are properly extracted from PGN headers
- ✅ Platform names (like "Chess.com") are never used as game_ids
- ✅ If extraction fails, a unique timestamp-based ID is generated
- ✅ Game existence is validated before attempting to save analysis
- ✅ Clear error messages when games don't exist in the database
- ✅ No more foreign key constraint violations due to invalid game_ids

## Impact

- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **Database Changes**: None
- **API Changes**: None (game_id parameter was already optional)
- **Performance**: Minimal impact (one additional SELECT query before save)
- **Error Handling**: Much improved with clearer error messages
