# Security Notes

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Chess Analytics application.

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Validation
- **Frontend**: Uses Zod for type-safe environment variable validation
- **Backend**: Uses Pydantic for robust configuration validation
- **Validation**: All environment variables are validated at startup
- **Security Checks**: Detects placeholder credentials and insecure configurations

### 2. Database Security
- **Parameterized Queries**: All database operations use Supabase's parameterized query system
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: No raw SQL queries or string concatenation
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Implemented on all database tables
- **Access Control**: Users can only access their own data

### 3. CORS Security
- **Strict Origins**: No wildcard CORS origins allowed
- **Environment-Specific**: Different CORS policies for development and production
- **Header Validation**: Only necessary headers are allowed
- **Credential Control**: Credentials are only allowed for trusted origins

### 4. Input Validation
- **Schema Validation**: All API inputs validated with Pydantic
- **Sanitization**: User inputs are sanitized before processing
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents many security issues

### 5. Error Handling
- **Structured Errors**: Consistent error responses without sensitive information
- **Logging**: Security events are logged for monitoring
- **Graceful Degradation**: Failures don't expose system internals

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Required environment variables
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
VITE_ANALYSIS_API_URL=http://localhost:8002

# Optional security variables
VITE_DEBUG=false
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Database Security
- All queries use Supabase's built-in parameterization
- RLS policies ensure data isolation
- No direct database access from frontend

### API Security
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting implemented
- CORS properly configured
- Error responses don't leak information

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: More permissive CORS for local development
- **Production**: Strict CORS with specific allowed origins
- **Credentials**: Placeholder values detected and warned about

### Known Limitations
- JWT validation currently disabled for development
- Some mock data may contain test credentials
- Rate limiting is basic (can be enhanced)

### Recommendations
1. **Enable JWT validation** in production
2. **Use HTTPS** for all production endpoints
3. **Implement proper rate limiting** with Redis or similar
4. **Add request logging** for security monitoring
5. **Regular security audits** of dependencies

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Logs to Monitor
- Environment validation failures
- CORS violations
- Authentication failures
- Rate limit violations
- Database access errors

### Security Headers
The application sets appropriate security headers:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: Restricted to allowed origins
- `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: Only for trusted origins
- `Access-Control-Max-Age`: Limited preflight cache time

## üö® Incident Response

### If Security Issues Are Detected
1. **Immediate**: Check logs for scope of issue
2. **Short-term**: Update CORS/validation rules
3. **Long-term**: Review and update security measures

### Contact Information
- Security issues should be reported privately
- Include steps to reproduce and potential impact
- Response time: Within 24 hours for critical issues
