# Game Import System Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified

Both game import types (smart import and large import) were failing with the error:
```
ERROR PGN upsert error: 'insert or update on table "games_pgn" violates foreign key constraint "fk_games_pgn_games"'
Key (user_id, platform, provider_game_id)=(taterama, chess.com, 144189847434) is not present in table "games".
```

## Root Cause

The `import_games()` function in `python/core/unified_api_server.py` had a critical flaw:

1. **Games table insert was attempted** (lines 2726-2732)
2. **If it failed, the error was caught** but execution continued
3. **PGN table insert was then attempted** (lines 2734-2746)
4. **PGN insert failed** with FK constraint violation because games records didn't exist

The foreign key constraint `fk_games_pgn_games` (added in migration `20240101000014_align_with_remote.sql`) ensures referential integrity by requiring every `games_pgn` record to have a corresponding `games` record.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Early Return on Games Insert Failure
**File:** `python/core/unified_api_server.py` (lines 2724-2769)

**Changes:**
- Added `games_insert_succeeded` flag to track if games insert worked
- If games insert fails, **immediately return** with error - don't attempt PGN insert
- Added validation to check if upsert actually returned data (RLS/constraint check)
- Added comprehensive error logging with traceback

**Before:**
```python
try:
    # Insert games
    games_response = supabase_service.table('games').upsert(games_rows).execute()
except Exception as exc:
    errors.append(f"games upsert failed: {exc}")  # But continues execution!

try:
    # Insert PGN - FAILS because games don't exist!
    pgn_response = supabase_service.table('games_pgn').upsert(pgn_rows).execute()
except Exception as exc:
    errors.append(f"games_pgn upsert failed: {exc}")
```

**After:**
```python
try:
    if games_rows:
        games_response = supabase_service.table('games').upsert(games_rows).execute()
        
        # Verify the insert actually worked
        if games_response.data is None or len(games_response.data) == 0:
            return BulkGameImportResponse(
                success=False,
                imported_games=0,
                errors=["games upsert returned no data"],
                message="Failed to import games"
            )
        
        games_insert_succeeded = True
except Exception as exc:
    # Return immediately - don't attempt PGN insert
    return BulkGameImportResponse(
        success=False,
        imported_games=0,
        errors=[f"games upsert failed: {exc}"],
        message="Failed to import games into database"
    )

# Only attempt PGN insert if games succeeded
if games_insert_succeeded:
    try:
        pgn_response = supabase_service.table('games_pgn').upsert(pgn_rows).execute()
    except Exception as exc:
        # Log error but don't fail completely since games were imported
        errors.append(f"games_pgn upsert failed: {exc}")
```

### 2. Enhanced Result Parsing for Chess.com
**File:** `python/core/unified_api_server.py` (lines 2293-2317)

**Changes:**
- Added explicit handling for `'repetition'` result (draw)
- Added explicit handling for `'abandoned'` result (draw)
- Improved logging to show result conversion

**Before:**
The catch-all `else` clause handled these, but they triggered warnings:
```
[WARNING] Unknown chess.com result: 'abandoned', defaulting to draw
[WARNING] Unknown chess.com result: 'repetition', defaulting to draw
```

**After:**
Now explicitly handled:
```python
elif result == 'repetition':
    result = 'draw'  # Threefold repetition is a draw
elif result == 'abandoned':
    result = 'draw'  # Abandoned games are typically draws
```

### 3. Improved Logging and Diagnostics
**File:** `python/core/unified_api_server.py`

**Added:**
- Sample game row logging before upsert (user_id, platform, provider_game_id, result)
- Games upsert response data length logging
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Full exception tracebacks for games insert failures
- Sample PGN row logging (without full PGN text to avoid log spam)

## How the Fix Works

### Flow Before Fix
```
1. Prepare games_rows and pgn_rows
2. Try games insert → FAILS (silently or with caught exception)
3. Try PGN insert → FAILS with FK constraint error (visible error)
4. Return with both errors
```

### Flow After Fix
```
1. Prepare games_rows and pgn_rows
2. Try games insert
   a. If exception → return immediately with clear error
   b. If no data returned → return immediately with RLS/constraint error
   c. If successful → continue to step 3
3. Try PGN insert (only if games succeeded)
   a. If fails → log error but still count games as imported
   b. If succeeds → full success
4. Return with appropriate success/error status
```

## Database Constraints

### Foreign Key Constraint
**Location:** `supabase/migrations/20240101000014_align_with_remote.sql` (line 246)

```sql
ALTER TABLE ONLY "public"."games_pgn"
ADD CONSTRAINT "fk_games_pgn_games" 
FOREIGN KEY ("user_id", "platform", "provider_game_id") 
REFERENCES "public"."games"("user_id", "platform", "provider_game_id") 
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

This constraint ensures:
- Every `games_pgn` record must have a matching `games` record
- If a `games` record is deleted, corresponding `games_pgn` records are automatically deleted
- **Critical implication:** Games MUST be inserted before PGN

### Result Constraint
**Location:** `supabase/migrations/20240101000000_initial_schema.sql` (line 8)

```sql
result TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (result IN ('win', 'loss', 'draw'))
```

This constraint ensures:
- Only 'win', 'loss', or 'draw' are allowed
- All platform-specific results must be converted to these three values
- Our parsing functions now handle all known Chess.com and Lichess result types

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Smart Import (100 games)
```bash
# For a new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/import-games-smart \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "testuser", "platform": "chess.com"}'
```

**Expected:** 
- Games inserted successfully
- PGN data inserted successfully
- No FK constraint errors
- Clear error messages if any issues

### 2. Test Large Import (5000 games)
```bash
# Start large import
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/import-more-games \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "testuser", "platform": "lichess", "limit": 5000}'

# Check progress
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/import-progress/testuser/lichess
```

**Expected:**
- Background import starts
- Progress updates correctly
- Games imported in batches
- No FK constraint errors
- Import completes successfully or reports clear errors

### 3. Verify in Database
```sql
-- Check games were imported
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games WHERE user_id = 'testuser' AND platform = 'chess.com';

-- Check PGN data was imported
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games_pgn WHERE user_id = 'testuser' AND platform = 'chess.com';

-- Verify FK integrity
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games WHERE user_id = 'testuser') as games_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games_pgn WHERE user_id = 'testuser') as pgn_count;
```

Both counts should match (assuming no PGN insert failures).

### 4. Check Logs
Look for these success indicators:
```
[import_games] Upserting 100 game rows
[import_games] Sample game row: user_id=testuser, platform=chess.com, provider_game_id=123, result=win
[import_games] games upsert response: count= 100
[import_games] games upsert response data length: 100
[import_games] games upsert succeeded: 100 rows affected
[import_games] Upserting 100 PGN rows
[import_games] pgn upsert successful, 100 rows affected
```

Look for these error indicators:
```
[import_games] ERROR: games upsert failed: <exception details>
[import_games] ERROR: games upsert returned no data - insert may have been blocked by RLS or constraints
```

## Files Modified

1. **`python/core/unified_api_server.py`**
   - Lines 2724-2769: Fixed `import_games()` function with early return
   - Lines 2771-2785: Updated PGN insert with better error handling
   - Lines 2293-2317: Enhanced Chess.com result parsing

## Potential Follow-up Issues

If imports still fail after this fix, check:

### 1. RLS Policies
Verify service_role can bypass RLS:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'games';
GRANT ALL ON games TO service_role;
```

### 2. Service Role Configuration
Verify `supabase_service` client is using service_role credentials:
```python
# In Python backend
print(f"Using service role: {supabase_service is not None}")
```

### 3. Database Connection
Verify Supabase connection is active:
```python
# Test query
result = supabase_service.table('games').select('id').limit(1).execute()
print(f"Connection test: {len(result.data)} rows")
```

### 4. Constraint Violations
Check for other constraints that might be blocking:
```sql
SELECT conname, contype, pg_get_constraintdef(oid) 
FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE conrelid = 'games'::regclass;
```

## Summary

The fix ensures that:
1. ✅ Games table inserts are validated before attempting PGN inserts
2. ✅ FK constraint violations are prevented by proper insert order
3. ✅ Clear error messages are provided when imports fail
4. ✅ All Chess.com result types are properly converted
5. ✅ Comprehensive logging aids in debugging any future issues

The import system should now work correctly for both platforms and both import types.
