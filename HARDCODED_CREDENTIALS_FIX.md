# Hard-coded Credentials Security Fix

## Issue Summary
CodeRabbit identified a critical security vulnerability where `update_pricing_db.py` contained a hard-coded Supabase service role key.

## Security Risk
- **Severity**: Critical ðŸ”´
- **Impact**: Full database access credentials exposed in source control
- **File**: `update_pricing_db.py`
- **Exposed credential**: Service role key `sb_secret_N7UND0UgjKTVK-Uodkm0Hg_xSvEMPvz`

## Fix Applied

### Before (lines 8-12):
```python
# Connect to local Supabase
url = "http://127.0.0.1:54321"
key = "sb_secret_N7UND0UgjKTVK-Uodkm0Hg_xSvEMPvz"  # pragma: allowlist secret - Example of removed local dev key

supabase: Client = create_client(url, key)
```

### After (lines 8-18):
```python
# Read credentials from environment variables
url = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_URL")
key = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY")

# Validate that both env vars are present
if not url:
    raise ValueError("SUPABASE_URL environment variable is required but not set")
if not key:
    raise ValueError("SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY environment variable is required but not set")

supabase: Client = create_client(url, key)
```

## Changes Made
1. âœ… Removed hard-coded Supabase URL and service role key
2. âœ… Added environment variable reading with `os.environ.get()`
3. âœ… Added validation to ensure both env vars are present
4. âœ… Added clear error messages if variables are missing

## Additional Findings
- âœ… Verified no other files contain the exposed key
- âœ… Confirmed `update_db_pricing.py` already uses environment variables correctly
- âœ… Confirmed `update_price_ids_now.py` uses the config system correctly

## Important Notes

### For Local Development
The exposed key was a **local development key** (URL: `http://127.0.0.1:54321`), which means:
- âœ… It only works on localhost
- âœ… It's not connected to production databases
- âœ… Lower risk than a production key exposure

However, even local keys should not be committed to source control as it's a bad security practice.

### Key Rotation
Since this appears to be a local Supabase key:
- The key is automatically regenerated each time you run `supabase start`
- No manual rotation needed unless you're using a persistent local instance
- If this is a shared development database, you may want to restart your local Supabase instance

### To Use the Script Now
```bash
# Set environment variables
export SUPABASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:54321"
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your_service_role_key"

# Or use a .env file (recommended)
# Then run:
python update_pricing_db.py
```

## Best Practices Applied
1. âœ… Read secrets from environment variables
2. âœ… Validate required variables are present
3. âœ… Provide clear error messages
4. âœ… Keep credentials out of source control

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Credentials removed and environment variable approach implemented
