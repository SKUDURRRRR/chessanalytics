## ‚úÖ Configuration Files (Verified)

### 1. `python/core/performance_config.py`
```python
stockfish_depth: int = 14              # Better depth for accuracy
stockfish_skill_level: int = 20        # Maximum strength
stockfish_time_limit: float = 0.8      # Fast analysis
max_concurrent_analyses: int = 4       # Parallel move processing
max_memory_usage_mb: int = 3072        # 3GB max (conservative)
```

### 2. `python/core/config.py`
```python
class StockfishConfig:
    depth: int = 14
    skill_level: int = 20
    time_limit: float = 0.8
    max_concurrent: int = 4
```

### 3. `python/core/analysis_engine.py`
```python
@dataclass
class AnalysisConfig:
    depth: int = 14  # Railway Hobby: Better depth
    skill_level: int = 20  # Railway Hobby: Maximum strength
    time_limit: float = 0.8  # Railway Hobby: Faster analysis
    max_concurrent: int = 4
```

### 4. `python/core/unified_api_server.py`
```python
class UnifiedAnalysisRequest(BaseModel):
    depth: Optional[int] = Field(14, ...)  # Railway Hobby default
    skill_level: Optional[int] = Field(20, ...)  # Railway Hobby default
```

## üîç Verification Commands

Run these to verify the configuration:

### Check Performance Config
```bash
cd python
python -c "from core.performance_config import get_performance_config, print_performance_config; config = get_performance_config(); print_performance_config(config)"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
=== Analysis Performance Configuration ===
Stockfish Depth: 14
Stockfish Skill Level: 20
Stockfish Time Limit: 0.8s
Stockfish Threads: 1
Stockfish Hash Size: 96MB
Max Concurrent Analyses: 4
...
```

### Check Analysis Engine Config
```bash
cd python
python -c "from core.analysis_engine import AnalysisConfig; config = AnalysisConfig(); print(f'depth={config.depth}, skill={config.skill_level}, time={config.time_limit}, concurrent={config.max_concurrent}')"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
depth=14, skill=20, time=0.8, concurrent=4
```

### Check Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/health
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "unified-chess-analysis-api",
  "version": "3.0.0",
  "stockfish_available": true,
  "analysis_types": ["stockfish", "deep"],
  "database_connected": true
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

No environment variables are needed for Railway Hobby settings. The defaults are built into the code.

If you want to override (not recommended unless testing):
```bash
# Don't set these unless you want to override defaults
# STOCKFISH_DEPTH=14
# STOCKFISH_SKILL_LEVEL=20
# STOCKFISH_TIME_LIMIT=0.8
# MAX_CONCURRENT_ANALYSES=4
```

---

## üîÑ Restart Commands

If you need to restart the app:

### Stop All
```powershell
.\stop-all.ps1
```

Or manually stop Python processes:
```powershell
Get-Process python | Stop-Process -Force
```

### Start Backend
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe python\main.py
```

### Start Frontend
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### Start Both (Recommended)
```powershell
.\start-all.ps1
```
