---

## üìã What You Need to Do (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Verify Database Migrations (5 minutes)

Go to Supabase SQL Editor: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nhpsnvhvfscrmyniihdn/sql

**Run these queries:**

```sql
-- Check if opening_normalized column exists
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'games' AND column_name = 'opening_normalized';
```

**Expected:** One row returned  
**If empty:** Apply `supabase/migrations/20251011232950_add_opening_normalized_SAFE.sql`

```sql
-- Check if reanalysis constraint is fixed
SELECT constraint_name 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE table_name = 'game_analyses' 
  AND constraint_name LIKE '%analysis_type%';
```

**Expected:** One row returned  
**If empty:** Apply `supabase/migrations/20250111000001_fix_game_analyses_constraint.sql`

---

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables (5 minutes)

#### Railway Backend (https://railway.app/dashboard)
Check these variables exist and are correct:
- [ ] `SUPABASE_URL` = `https://nhpsnvhvfscrmyniihdn.supabase.co`
- [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` = (your key)
- [ ] `STOCKFISH_DEPTH` = `14`
- [ ] `STOCKFISH_TIME_LIMIT` = `0.8`
- [ ] `MAX_CONCURRENT_ANALYSES` = `4`
- [ ] `PERFORMANCE_PROFILE` = `railway_hobby`
- [ ] `DEBUG` = `false` ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

#### Vercel Frontend (https://vercel.com/dashboard)
Check these variables exist and are correct:
- [ ] `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = `https://nhpsnvhvfscrmyniihdn.supabase.co`
- [ ] `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = (your key)
- [ ] `VITE_ANALYSIS_API_URL` = (your Railway backend URL)
- [ ] `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- [ ] `VITE_DEBUG` = `false` ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

---

### Step 3: Deploy (10 minutes)

```bash
# In your chess-analytics directory

# 1. Add all changes
git add .

# 2. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Pre-deployment: Debug cleanup, validation, and improvements

- Made debug endpoints conditional on DEBUG env variable
- Made debug panel conditional on VITE_DEBUG env variable
- Added comprehensive deployment documentation
- Validated all major functionality
- Ready for production deployment"

# 3. Push to production branch (triggers auto-deploy)
git push origin development

# Railway and Vercel will automatically deploy
```

**Monitor Deployment:**
- **Railway:** Check deployment logs for "Service started successfully"
- **Vercel:** Check build logs for "Build completed"

---

### Step 4: Quick Validation (10 minutes)

Once deployed:

#### 1. Test Backend Health
Visit: `https://your-backend.railway.app/health`  
**Expected:** `{"status": "healthy"}`

#### 2. Test Frontend
Open your production URL  
**Check:**
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No CORS errors
- [ ] Page loads correctly

#### 3. Quick Smoke Test
1. Search for a chess username (e.g., "hikaru")
2. Import 100 games
3. Start analysis
4. View match history
5. Check one game analysis

**Expected:** Everything works smoothly
