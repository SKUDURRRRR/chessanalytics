# Opening ECO Code Display Fix

## Issue
The opening performance section was showing ECO codes (e.g., "C53") instead of user-friendly opening names (e.g., "Italian Game").

### Screenshot of Issue
Users were seeing:
- "Needs work: C53" ❌
- Instead of: "Needs work: Italian Game" ✅

## Root Cause
The `_analyze_repertoire()` function in `python/core/unified_api_server.py` was directly using the value from the `opening_normalized` database column, which stores ECO codes for consistency.

### Code Flow
1. Database stores `opening_normalized` = "C53" (for consistency in queries)
2. Backend reads "C53" directly
3. Backend returns "C53" in `repertoireAnalysis.needsWork.opening`
4. Frontend displays "C53" without conversion

## Solution
Updated `_analyze_repertoire()` to convert ECO codes to full opening names using the existing `get_opening_name_from_eco_code()` utility function.

### Changes Made
**File:** `python/core/unified_api_server.py`

**Before:**
```python
def _analyze_repertoire(games: List[Dict[str, Any]], personality_scores: Dict[str, float]) -> RepertoireAnalysis:
    for game in games:
        opening = game.get('opening_normalized') or game.get('opening')
        if not opening or opening == 'Unknown':
            continue

        # Used raw opening value (e.g., "C53")
        if color == 'white':
            white_openings[opening] += 1
        elif color == 'black':
            black_openings[opening] += 1
```

**After:**
```python
def _analyze_repertoire(games: List[Dict[str, Any]], personality_scores: Dict[str, float]) -> RepertoireAnalysis:
    for game in games:
        opening = game.get('opening_normalized') or game.get('opening')
        if not opening or opening == 'Unknown':
            continue

        # Convert ECO codes to full opening names for better display
        display_opening = get_opening_name_from_eco_code(opening)

        # Use converted display name
        if color == 'white':
            white_openings[display_opening] += 1
        elif color == 'black':
            black_openings[display_opening] += 1
```

## ECO Code Mapping Examples
The `get_opening_name_from_eco_code()` function converts:
- `C53` → "Italian Game"
- `B20` → "Sicilian Defense"
- `D10` → "Slav Defense"
- `E60` → "King's Indian Defense"
- And 500+ more ECO codes

If the value is already a full name (not an ECO code), it returns the original value unchanged.

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Restart the backend server
2. Navigate to the Opening Analysis page
3. Check that "Your Opening Performance" shows full opening names:
   - ✅ "Best: Italian Game"
   - ✅ "Needs work: Sicilian Defense"
   - ❌ NOT "Needs work: C53"

## Impact
- ✅ No database changes required
- ✅ No frontend changes required
- ✅ Backward compatible (handles both ECO codes and full names)
- ✅ Improves user experience with readable opening names
- ✅ Maintains data consistency (database still stores ECO codes)
